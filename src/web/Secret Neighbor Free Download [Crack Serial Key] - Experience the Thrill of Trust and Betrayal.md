If you are new to Secret Neighbor, you might want to know some tips and tricks to improve your chances of winning as a Kid or as a Neighbor. Here are some of them:

- Think colorfully. When playing as a Kid, start by scoping out the door and note the lock colors. Then look for keys that match those colors and avoid wasting time on keys that don't. You can also use your flashlight to highlight the keyholes and see their colors from afar.
- Double means trouble. The evil Neighbor can transform himself into a copy of a nearby childâa sinister power heâll use to catch kids by surprise. If you see two identical kids running around, be suspicious and keep your distance. You can also use voice chat to communicate with your teammates and confirm their identities.
- Carry on. As a Kid, you can carry various items that can help you in your quest. For example, you can carry a bear trap to slow down the Neighbor, a firework to distract him, or a radio to play music and lure him away. You can also carry weapons such as bats, shovels, or frying pans to fight back if you encounter the Neighbor.
- Know your role. Each Kid has a unique ability that can give them an edge in the game. For example, the Bagger can carry more items than others, the Detective can see key locations on the map, the Scout can sprint faster and jump higher, and the Leader can heal other kids with candy bars. Learn how to use your ability effectively and cooperate with your teammates.
- Keep an ear out. As a Neighbor, you can use sound cues to locate and catch the Kids. Listen for footsteps, doors opening and closing, keys jingling, radios playing, fireworks exploding, and voice chat conversations. You can also use your own voice chat to deceive the Kids and pretend to be one of them.

Secret Neighbor is a game that requires strategy, teamwork, deception, and survival skills. Whether you play as a Kid or as a Neighbor, you will have to use your wits and resources to outsmart your opponents and achieve your objective. The game also offers different game modes and maps to keep things fresh and exciting. If you are looking for a social horror game that will challenge you and your friends, Secret Neighbor is a great choice.
